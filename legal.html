      <h2>1. Information only — not legal advice</h2>
      <p>
        Law &amp; Learning is an educational initiative. It develops study tools, resources and learning systems for law students, educators and professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials on this site are designed to support legal education. They are not legal, financial or professional advice, and they are not a substitute for reading primary sources. Doctrine cards, hypotheticals, retrieval practice tools and other study resources summarise and simplify legal concepts for learning purposes. They do not provide a complete or authoritative statement of the law on any topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this site does not create a solicitor-client, tutor-student or advisory relationship. If you need legal advice, you should seek independent advice from a qualified professional in your jurisdiction. If you are relying on legal concepts for academic assessment, always verify against primary sources — legislation, case law and your institution's prescribed materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Study materials may reference legislation, case law and legal principles for educational context. These references may be simplified, selective, incomplete or superseded by subsequent developments. The law changes. What is accurate at the time of publication may not remain so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless clearly stated otherwise, all views are those of the project lead (Jay Spudvilas) and do not represent any university, law school, employer, agency or organisation.

      <h2>2. About Law &amp; Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Law &amp; Learning is a project of Jay Spudvilas (Jayden Spudvilas-Powell), operating in a personal capacity. References to "Law &amp; Learning" and "we" on this site refer to this project and its author. Law &amp; Learning is not a registered legal entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Law &amp; Learning is an independent educational initiative. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of any university, law school, or professional legal body — including the Australian National University, where the project lead is a Juris Doctor candidate.

      <h2>3. Study materials &amp; educational content</h2>
      <p>
        Study resources on this site — including doctrine cards, hypotheticals, structured study guides, retrieval practice tools and exam preparation materials — are educational aids. They are designed to support learning, not to replace it.
      </p>
      <p>These materials do not constitute:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>authoritative statements of law</li>
        <li>legal advice or guidance on any specific matter</li>
        <li>official course materials for any university or law school</li>
        <li>professional development or continuing legal education (CLE/CPD) content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hypotheticals are fictional scenarios created for educational purposes. Any resemblance to actual cases, persons or events is incidental unless a case is explicitly cited. Where real cases are referenced, the treatment is simplified for learning purposes and should not be cited as legal analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials grounded in cognitive science (such as spaced repetition schedules, retrieval practice frameworks and study design guidance) reflect published research as understood at the time of writing. Cognitive science is an evolving field. We do not guarantee that any particular study method will produce specific academic outcomes. Individual results depend on many factors beyond the design of study materials.
      </p>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>4. Accuracy &amp; liability</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to keep materials accurate and up to date, but we cannot guarantee completeness or that everything remains current. Law changes. Legislation is amended. Court decisions evolve the interpretation of statutory provisions. Academic curricula change. Content on this site may not reflect the most recent developments in any of these areas.

To the extent permitted by law, Law &amp; Learning is not liable for any loss, damage or costs arising from your use of, or reliance on, this site or any linked resources. This includes, but is not limited to, any academic outcomes, assessment results or professional consequences arising from reliance on study materials published here. Nothing in this notice excludes, restricts or modifies any consumer guarantee or other right that cannot be excluded under Australian law.

      <p>
        This site uses Google Analytics and Ahrefs Analytics to understand aggregate traffic and usage patterns. We do not use these tools for advertising or behavioural profiling.

        The site works even if you block cookies or JavaScript in your browser. If you would prefer not to be tracked, you can manage or block cookies through your browser settings and extensions. Nothing will break. If you are located in the European Union, we recommend blocking analytics cookies, as this site does not currently implement a cookie consent banner.

      <h2>7. Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to make this site accessible to all users, including people with disabilities and neurodivergent learners. The site is designed to work with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and browser-based assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Study materials are designed with structured clarity — layered complexity, consistent formatting and retrieval-optimised design — informed by the evidence-based design principles that underpin the project. If you encounter an accessibility barrier on this site, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@lawandlearning.com">hello@lawandlearning.com</a> so we can address it.
