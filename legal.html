      <p>
        Law &amp; Learning is an educational initiative. It develops study tools, resources and learning systems for law students, educators and professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials on this site are designed to support legal education. They are not legal, financial or professional advice, and they are not a substitute for reading primary sources. Doctrine cards, hypotheticals, retrieval practice tools and other study resources summarise and simplify legal concepts for learning purposes. They do not provide a complete or authoritative statement of the law on any topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this site does not create a solicitor-client, tutor-student or advisory relationship. If you need legal advice, you should seek independent advice from a qualified professional in your jurisdiction. If you are relying on legal concepts for academic assessment, always verify against primary sources — legislation, case law and your institution's prescribed materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Study materials may reference legislation, case law and legal principles for educational context. These references may be simplified, selective, incomplete or superseded by subsequent developments. The law changes. What is accurate at the time of publication may not remain so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless clearly stated otherwise, all views are those of the project lead (Jay Spudvilas) and do not represent any university, law school, employer, agency or organisation.

      <h2 id="s2">About Law &amp; Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Law &amp; Learning is a project of Jay Spudvilas (Jayden Spudvilas-Powell), operating in a personal capacity. References to "Law &amp; Learning" and "we" on this site refer to this project and its author. Law &amp; Learning is not a registered legal entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Law &amp; Learning is an independent educational initiative. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of any university, law school, or professional legal body — including the Australian National University, where the project lead is a Juris Doctor candidate.

      <p class="legal-section-num">Section 3</p>
      <h2 id="s3">Study materials &amp; educational content</h2>
      <p>
        Study resources on this site — including doctrine cards, hypotheticals, structured study guides, retrieval practice tools and exam preparation materials — are educational aids. They are designed to support learning, not to replace it.
      </p>
      <p>These materials do not constitute:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>authoritative statements of law</li>
        <li>legal advice or guidance on any specific matter</li>
        <li>official course materials for any university or law school</li>
        <li>professional development or continuing legal education (CLE/CPD) content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hypotheticals are fictional scenarios created for educational purposes. Any resemblance to actual cases, persons or events is incidental unless a case is explicitly cited. Where real cases are referenced, the treatment is simplified for learning purposes and should not be cited as legal analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials grounded in cognitive science (such as spaced repetition schedules, retrieval practice frameworks and study design guidance) reflect published research as understood at the time of writing. Cognitive science is an evolving field. We do not guarantee that any particular study method will produce specific academic outcomes. Individual results depend on many factors beyond the design of study materials.

      <h2 id="s4">Accuracy &amp; liability</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to keep materials accurate and up to date, but we cannot guarantee completeness or that everything remains current. Law changes. Legislation is amended. Court decisions evolve the interpretation of statutory provisions. Academic curricula change. Content on this site may not reflect the most recent developments in any of these areas.

      <p>
        All content on this site is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

        Use of this site is at your discretion. To the extent permitted by law, Law &amp; Learning is not liable for any loss, damage or costs arising from your use of, or reliance on, this site or any linked resources. This includes, but is not limited to, any academic outcomes, assessment results or professional consequences arising from reliance on study materials published here. Nothing in this notice excludes, restricts or modifies any consumer guarantee or other right that cannot be excluded under Australian law.

      <h2 id="s6">Privacy, analytics &amp; cookies</h2>
      <p>
        This site uses Google Analytics and Ahrefs Analytics to understand aggregate traffic and usage patterns. We do not use these tools for advertising or behavioural profiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        These services use cookies and similar technologies to collect information such as page views, referrers, approximate location, device and browser information and IP addresses. We use this information in aggregate to understand how the site is used and to improve the content. We do not sell personal data, combine analytics data with other data to profile named individuals, or attempt to re-identify people from analytics data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site works even if you block cookies or JavaScript in your browser. If you would prefer not to be tracked, you can manage or block cookies through your browser settings and extensions. Nothing will break.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you contact us, we will take reasonable steps to delete or de-identify any logs we can associate with you, subject to technical limits and legal record-keeping requirements. These providers may process information on servers outside Australia (for example, in the United States or the European Union). You can learn more in their own privacy materials:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ahrefs.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs Privacy Policy</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We process analytics data on the basis of legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) — specifically, our interest in understanding how the site is used so we can maintain and improve it. Under the Australian Privacy Act, this collection falls within the "reasonably expected" secondary purpose exception (APP 6.2(a)). We have conducted a legitimate interests assessment and determined that this processing is proportionate, minimally intrusive, and does not override the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The data collected does not include special category data, is not used for profiling, and is processed in aggregate form.
      </p>
      <p>
        We maintain internal governance records including a legitimate interests assessment, a record of processing activities and a data subject rights handling procedure. These are available on request to any supervisory authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Analytics scripts do not load unless you explicitly accept them via the cookie consent banner presented on your first visit. The default state is decline — no analytics data is collected unless you choose to opt in. You can withdraw consent at any time via the "Cookie settings" link in the footer, or by blocking cookies through your browser settings or extensions such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you subscribe to our mailing list or use our contact forms, your data is processed by <a href="https://formspree.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formspree</a>, which acts as a data processor on our behalf (<a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formspree Privacy Policy</a>). We collect your email address to send updates about new study tools, resources, and opportunities to provide feedback on what we build. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link provided in each email. Mailing list data is retained until you unsubscribe or after 24 months of inactivity. Suppression data (a record of unsubscribed addresses) is retained indefinitely under our legitimate interests in ensuring compliance with unsubscribe requests and preventing further unwanted contact. We do not share mailing list data with third parties or use it for any purpose other than sending the updates you signed up for.
      </p>
      <p>
        We access and use analytics data in aggregate form only. Google Analytics event data is retained for 14 months. Ahrefs operates as an independent data controller; we do not retain personal data from Ahrefs — see their privacy policy above for their own retention practices. Contact form submissions and inbox correspondence are retained for up to 24 months, unless an ongoing professional relationship exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each site we operate (glasscase.org, lightkey.org, lawandlearning.com, jayspudvilas.com) uses its own separate Google Analytics property. There is no cross-domain tracking and no cross-site aggregation of analytics data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme under Part IIIC of the Privacy Act may not apply to this project directly, we voluntarily commit to notifying affected users of any significant data breach that we become aware of and that is likely to affect their personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is not directed at children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can contact us to ask what personal information, if any, we hold about you. If you believe any personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you can contact us to request correction. If you believe we have handled your personal information in a way that breaches your privacy, you can contact us to make a complaint and we will respond within 30 days.

      <div class="legal-callout">
        <p>We aim to make this site accessible to all users, including people with disabilities and neurodivergent learners. Accessibility is built into the design, not added afterwards.</p>
      </div>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
        The site is designed to work with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and browser-based assistive technologies. Study materials are designed with structured clarity — layered complexity, consistent formatting and retrieval-optimised design — informed by the evidence-based design principles that underpin the project.
